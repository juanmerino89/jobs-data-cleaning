# Jobs data cleaning

In this repository, I cleaned the files from the folder [data](https://github.com/juanmerino89/jobs-data-cleaning/blob/main/data/). These files, in extension xlsx, are coming from a web scraping of Indeed, including job postings from the data searches from the file [job_search](https://github.com/juanmerino89/jobs-data-cleaning/blob/main/job_search.xlsx).
The extraction was done with Power Automate along almost two weeks.

The data cleaning it's included in the notebook [JobsDataCleaning](https://github.com/juanmerino89/jobs-data-cleaning/blob/main/JobsDataCleaning.ipynb).

The final [data](https://github.com/juanmerino89/jobs-data-cleaning/blob/main/jobs.csv), is structured as follows:
